Portfoly is an android app for keeping track of cryptocurrencies in your portfolio. You can create/remove several portfolios and add/delete different cyrptocurrencies to them.

The app takes advantage of MVVM architecture pattern and supports offline caching.

Tech stack:
- Retrofit, Room, Dagger Hilt, Glide, Jetpack libs, Kotlin Flows; 
- I used MpAndroidChart library (https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) for displaying a pie chart
- A big part of "networkBoundResource" method is taken from this tutorial by Florian Walther https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9XKb4iGM-4&t=2062s
